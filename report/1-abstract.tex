In which we talk about scotch.

We will talk about

\begin{itemize}
    \item Sample Mean
    \item Variance
    \item Standard Deviation
    \item Boxplots 
    \item Point estimates for means
    \item Point estimates for variances
    \item Point estimates for std. devs
    \item Point estimates for proportions
    \item Bias
    \item Efficiency
    \item Consistency
    \item Sufficiency
    \item Confidence Intervals for means
    \item Confidence Intervals for difference of means
    \item Confidence Intervals for variances
    \item Confidence Intervals for ratio of two variances
    \item Confidence Intervals for proportions
    \item Confidence Intervals for difference between proportions
    \item Make confidence statements related to data
    \item Specify which statistic you use for computing the CI
    \item Specify under what assumption you work
    \item include formulas as necessary
    \item Find sample sizes that would be needed in order to decrease the max error to a desired value
    \item Testing hypotheses
    \item Test at least two hypotheses about means, differences of means (two means or ANOVA), variances, proportions (binomial or multinomial), independence (contingency table), goodness of fit
    \item State assumptions and draw conclusions in the context of the data
    \item Perform linear regression and / or normal correlation analysis
    \item Any other statistical aspects or tests
\end{itemize}
