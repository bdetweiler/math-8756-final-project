\chapter{Conclusion}

In this paper, first and foremost, we saw that age does not imply price. But we also saw that the lower bound of price by age can be fit to a quadratic.

We also saw that prices can vary wildly by age and by retailer, but using the algorithm presented in 2.3, we have a list of places to look in order of best to worst. Of course, only the prices of the bottles were considered, not shipping, sales, minimum orders, etc. So while the algorithm doesn't exactly make a decision for you, it does make your decision easier, and could, in the future, be made to make the decision entirely.
