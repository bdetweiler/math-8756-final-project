Palate entry is aggressive in spirit, but sweet and pruny; midpalate is drier and features tastes of leather and grain. Aftertaste teems with oak resin, hard cheese (meaning, rancio), candied nuts, candied fruit and dark honey. Add mineral water." (12/2009) 90 points Whisky Advocate: "Amber, with shades of ruby.

 Aberlour 12 Year Old Non-Chill Filtered Single Malt Whisky (750ml) Aberlour 12 Year Old Non-Chill Filtered Single Malt Whisky (750ml)
We've long felt that the Aberlour 12 year was one of the great deals in single malt. Now, Aberlour has stepped it up a bit by releasing their double-matured malt (like Balvenie, but not advertised as such) in a higher proof (48%), non-chill filtered edition. The difference is remarkable. It's so much better that I want to forget the normal Aberlour exists. The fruit pops more, the richness is spicier, and the finish is longer. I love high-proof whisky that isn't cask strength, and this is now a new favorite. Lots of sherry, lots of Fig Newton cookie, lo... Read More »

A rare older offering from this modern Dufftown distillery. Allt-A-Bhainne was built in 1975 to provide a high quality Speyside malt whisky base for the big blends. It's highly prized for its consistent nature so the blenders rarely let it go and typically when we find them they're quite young and neutral. Not surprisingly aged in a refill hogshead, the additional time has allowed the wonderful mellow character of AAB to develop nicely. Lovely floral and vanilla aromas revolve around a peppery core.

We're batting 1.000 with their sherry-matured inventory, and this new hogshead cask is quite possibly the grand slam of finds. It's not a sherry bomb by any means, as it beautifully meanders from stonefruit and creamy malt into elements of cakebread and spice, but then back to the soft vanilla of the malt again.

But a few years back the supply chain began to get a bit tight and the company decided to invest in production, purchasing the Tamdhu and Glengoyne distilleries respectively. We saw few Chieftain's selections after that point and had all but ... Read More »

 1990 Bruichladdich "K&L Exclusive" 23 Year Old Signatory Refill Sherry Butt Cask Strength Islay Single Malt Scotch Whisky (750ml) Top Pick! 1990 Bruichladdich "K&L Exclusive" 23 Year Old Signatory Refill Sherry Butt Cask Strength Islay Single Malt Scotch Whisky (750ml)
Clearly, we went a little Refill Sherry crazy this year, but how could we resist. We've been tasting this special cask every year since we first set foot in Signatory's wonderful warehouses and we finally felt that it had reached its true peak. Bruichladdich is probably pretty sore that they don't own this cask because it's the perfect example of the unpeated Islay Malt. This hits every note without skipping a beat (while skipping the peat). The perfect amount of ripe round malty spice mixed with zesty citrus fruit. An ever so subtle oceany brine. The su...

From the distillery: "This, Octomore 07.3, is the second release OF Octomore. Made from barley grown two miles along the coast from the distiller and farmer and friend James Brown's Octomore farm. It was distilled in 2010 from grain harvested on Lorgba field the previous summer, peated to 169ppm and matured here on Islay for all its life in American bourbon barrels and Spanish wine casks of Ribera del Duero. Uber provenance, uber experimental, Octomore of Octomore embodies the quintessence of our philosophy. Elegant, powerful, deep and proud of its Islay... Read More »

 Bruichladdich "Rockside Farms" Islay Barley Single Malt Whisky (750ml) Bruichladdich "Rockside Farms" Islay Barley Single Malt Whisky (750ml)
This six year old whisky uses barley from nearby Rockside Farm (the same source Kilchoman uses for their 100% Islay whiskies) to make an expressive, pure, and dynamic single malt of supreme character. Much like Bruichladdich showcased with their fantastic Bere Barley release a while back, the barley really can make a huge difference when you don't mask the inherent flavor of the whisky with sherry maturation or heavy peat. The aromas of the whisky are full of sweet grains, heady vanilla, and hints of caramel mixed with faint butterscotch. The palate is l... Read More »

This glorious youngish Laddie, from the early stages of the Reynier era, is one of the very first independent bottlings we've seen from this period stateside. A moment in whisky history frozen in time and delivered directly to us via Mr David Stirk's warehouses. By 2004 when this cask was distilled, the distillery was well into fomenting a veritable single malt revolution. They were obviously on the right track because this little cask shows all the wonderful rich malt and dense fruitiness you'd expect from our dear Laddie. The stony shores of Loch Indaa...

Made by Bruichladdich Distillery, which is renowned for its Scotch, on a pot-still named Ugly Betty. Sold in an attractive, square-shouldered, gift-worthy bottle."

(2/2011) K&L Notes: God bless Andrew Symington and Iain Henderson for what they have helped to create at Scotland's smallest distillery. It is also the closest to the working 19th-century farm distilleries that used to be found all over central Perthshire. Just imagine, huge external worm tubs ... Read More »

For three long years, David Othenin-Girard and I have been trying to create an inexpensive, delicious, value-driven, yet simultaneously interesting expression of blended Scotch whisky that we could feature under our Faultline label. There were many times when we thought we were close, but either the quality of the whisky or the cost of the barrels proved prohibitive. We didn't want to make a $25 bottle of whisky just for the sake of it. If we were going to do it, then we were going to it right. Finally, after working on and off with the Laings for a year...

This magnificent Glen Elgin drawn from a single first fill sherry butt is one of the finest examples we've ever tasted from this special little distillery.

Every year at K&L we have a few sleeper casks of whisky: barrels full of incredible whisky at incredible prices, but without well-known names or widely-established reputations. This 24 year Bourbon barrel of Glen Elgin is exactly that: a total sleeper hit that offers tremendous quality and lots of bang for the buck.

The Glen Garioch distillery, hidden behind the residential streets of the Oldmeldrum, is one of Scotland's oldest and finest single malt producers. This magnificent cask comes from the final moments before the distillery closed in October of 1995 for nearly 2 years.

 Glendronach Peated Highland Single Malt Scotch Whisky (750ml) Glendronach Peated Highland Single Malt Scotch Whisky (750ml)
This is a lightly peated and youngish whisky from Glendronach and it's quite delightful. It's like something in between Springbank and Bruichladdich in terms of peat intensity and also in terms of richness. In fact, it reminds us fondly of the Laddie 10 before they were forced to discontinue the age statement. Aged in bourbon casks, then finished in sherry, the youth of the liquid is palpable in the fruitiness of the spirit, but the soft peat and richness from the wood more than makes up for it.

When George Grant offered us the opportunity to take multiple casks for a special exclusive bottling, we were over the moon. The creative juices began flowing. We talked about doing an ultra-aged expression, but we didn't feel we could match the outrageous cask from the 1970 vintage, which we'd acquired a couple of years back. Instead, we decided to focus on a NAS (no age statement) mixture of casks from earlier vintages. The goal was to create a high proof, heavily sherried 'Farclas that we could sell for around $100.

 1995 Imperial 19 Year Old K&L Exclusive Signatory Single Barrel Cask Strength Single Malt Whisky (750ml) Top Pick! 1995 Imperial 19 Year Old K&L Exclusive Signatory Single Barrel Cask Strength Single Malt Whisky (750ml)
This being our third cask of 1995 Imperial from Signatory, you can tell we're really quite in love with this whisky. Imagine Glenmorangie 18, but at cask strength and with extra-oiliness and that's pretty much what you're getting here; albeit this time around with an extra year in wood. Imperial is also a "lost" distillery, meaning that's no longer in existence. Closed in the late 1990s and demolished completely off the face of the earth in 2013, each drop of Imperial consumed means there's that much less left in the world. The first sip is a like butter...

Almost 100% of Inchgower's single malt whisky production goes into Johnnie Walker and Bell's blended whiskies, so the chance to taste a single, unblended cask of the Speyside facility's whisky was something we were definitely interested in. This sherry-aged beast of a malt should attract the attention of Mortlach and Blair Athol fans who have feasted on the dark, dense, meaty flavors of heavily-sherried casks we've purchased in the past. The richness of the Oloroso density is buffered by a strong note of earthy, savory, almost sulfury intensity; a broodi... Read More »

Fresh off our most recent delivery are two new single barrels of Invergordon, a Whyte & Mackay Highland grain distillery that sits along the waters of the Cromarty Firth north of Inverness. For those of you who still can't wrap your heads around grain whisky, just imagine Bourbon distilled to a higher proof and aged like single malt in various types of refill barrels. It's basically high proof, column still whisky made from corn, wheat, or unmalted barley that's pumped out in mass quantities to mix into blended Scotch. Because of that rather dubious repu...

Soft, gentle flavors of vanilla, toffee, subtle fruit and brine, with a dryish oaky finish.

 Isle Of Skye 12 Year Old Blended Scotch Whisky (750ml) Isle Of Skye 12 Year Old Blended Scotch Whisky (750ml)
Blended together and then aged for additional months in oak casks, this new, more mature blend of Isle of Skye is far superior to its 8 year old counterpart. While the 8 year has a classic grain component, the 12 year smooths all of that greenness out with more supple wood, rounding out the palate and really bringing the Talisker smoke to the forefront. For less than $40, this is one of the hottest deals we have in Scotch. It's meant to be drunk on the rocks, but you could have a great time sipping this one.

Great balance too, with the island aggressiveness tamed by a rich, malty elegance.

 Johnnie Walker 10 Year Old "Select Casks" Rye Cask Finish Blended Scotch Whisky (750ml) Johnnie Walker 10 Year Old "Select Casks" Rye Cask Finish Blended Scotch Whisky (750ml)
This is a total shocker of a whisky. A bold attempt to break out of the norm from one of the most conservative and classic whisky producers in the industry (if not the most). The 10 year old Rye Cask finish blended whisky from Johnnie Walker takes 10 year old Bourbon barrel-aged stocks of Scotch from Diageo's vast supply and sees them aged additionally in barrels formerly used to age American rye whisky. The result is far more intense than anyone would imagine. The rye completely dominates the flavor profile with accents of dill and German bread, but the... Read More »

It's no secret that we're big fans of Kilchoman distillery here at K&L. Our recent visit to the distillery on Islay really opened our eyes to the incredible job they're doing. Kilchoman is a tiny operation, producing on one still and malting whatever they can inside their humble barn. Because of their small scale, their cost of production is higher and prices for their whisky have not been inexpensive. But having tasted the new-make spirit right off the still, I can firmly say that, in my opinion, there is no higher quality peated whisky being produced a... Read More »

Whisky Advocate: "Youthful and fiery, oozing with testosterone. Toffee apple intoxicated with kiln-trapped peat smoke, charcoal ash, anise, honeyed malt, brine, peppered seaweed, kippers, and damp earth. Brisk and warming. Okay, this is a young, 'in your face' Islay single malt. Young Islay whiskies show the true character of Islay (which I like), and this is a young one. Ideally, I’d like to see another five years, not chill-filtered, and bottled at 46% ABV, but there’s still a sort of 'raw edge' attraction here." K&L Notes: Bottled by Ian Macleod, the man behind the Isle of Skye and... Read More »

The Springbank 10 year old is the perfect whisky to introduce you to this distiller's range. Matured in Sherry and Bourbon casks, this is a richly balanced expression.

 Springbank 12 Year Old Cask Strength Single Malt Whisky (750ml) Springbank 12 Year Old Cask Strength Single Malt Whisky (750ml)
This most recent batch of Springbank's fan favorite 12 year old cask strength is right in line with what the distillery does best: hints of amontillado sherry on the nose with savory almond notes and accents of caramelized fruit. The richness and the viscosity of the malt make this a standout on the shelf. While Springbank's whisky always demands a premium price, it's easy to see why people are willing to pay it. That faint whisper of smoke on the finish with the phenolic, oily finale is absolutely delicious.

 Springbank 15 Year Old Distillery Bottling Single Malt Scotch Whisky (750ml) Springbank 15 Year Old Distillery Bottling Single Malt Scotch Whisky (750ml)
96-100 points Wine Enthusiast: "The complex, understated bouquet finds aromas of barley malt, seaweed, heather, oaky vanilla, honey, sherry cask, scrambled egg and minerals. The palate entry is oily, buttery and oaky sweet; by midpalate the flavors include assertive tastes of marzipan, marshmallow, baked pear/peach pastry and bacon fat. Finishes with a luscious fruit/grape thrust. A masterpiece." (4/2008) Whisky Advocate: "Powerful, mature, and nicely rounded. Similar in some ways to the Springer 10 year old 46% reviewed below, with the addition of toasted coconut and caramel. It’s also more rounded and w ...Read More »

 Springbank 18 Year Old Campbeltown Single Malt Scotch (750ml) Springbank 18 Year Old Campbeltown Single Malt Scotch (750ml)
Whisky Advocate: "A good dose of sherry here, but there’s plenty of Springbank character coming through too! Gobs of ripe, red berried fruit (strawberry, rhubarb, red currant, raspberry), especially on the nose, along with raisin. It’s all on a bed of blueberry pancakes, toffee, and fig cake. Coconut and brine emerge occasionally on the palate and linger on the finish. (Vol. 19, #3)" (7/2010) Wine Spectator: "A delightful romp, this starts with a very fruity, almost Cognac-like nose of apple and pear, then gets very candied on the palate, with honey and fruit flavors, developing spicy notes ...Read More »

Part of our newly-acquired Hunter Laing "Old & Rare" series, this single sherry butt of Springbank marks one of the great cask acquisitions in the history of our spirits department, in terms of both the quality of the whisky itself and the rarity of the liquid in general. Years ago we were able to purchase 10-12 year old cask selections directly from the legendary Campbeltown distillery, one of the last family-owned operations in Scotland. However, increased demand and an inability to maintain sufficient stocks quickly ended that program, while limitatio... Read More »

This is a much-anticipated new release from Springbank, the oldest independent family-owned distillery in Scotland. It's been matured in Bourbon, Sherry, and Port casks for a trifecta of deep, nuanced flavor. From the producer: "The nose is rich with a peated Port influence. It’s redolent of the dunnage warehouse in which it was matured. Fruity too, but this time berries to the fore: blackberries, cranberries, and strawberries. The Port wine influence is perfectly balanced with flavours of sherry, plum jam, blood oranges, and pink grapefruit. The finish ... Read More »

 Stronachie 18 year old Single Malt Whisky (750ml) Stronachie 18 year old Single Malt Whisky (750ml)
This fabulous recreation of one of Scotland's closed distilleries is sourced from the unusual and rare Benrinnes Distillery in Speyside. The Morrisons of A.D. Rattray compared samples from the original Stronachie Distillery, distilled in 1904, to the Highland and Speyside's finest malts until the located a stylistic match. The 18 year is bottled in small batches, using both bourbon hogshead and sherry butts. Benrinnes, sometimes compared to Mortlach, has a very earthy almost herbal side. Truly a great value from A.D.

Whisky Advocate: "Diageo has introduced this new no age statement variant of Talisker single malt. The name reflects the distiller’s aspiration to enhance the maritime notes in this expression. Refill and rejuvenated casks have both contributed to its maturation. The nose is youthful but rounded, with brine, burning wood embers, vanilla, and honey. Sweet and spicy on the palate, with cranberries and black currants, while peat smoke is always present, plus black pepper. The finish lingers, with walnuts and fruity peat.

90 points Whisky Advocate: "Another that should need no introduction. The thing to look for in Talisker, as with all smoky whiskies, is sweetness that gives the requisite balance to the drying effect of smoke. Underneath Talisker’s smoke, which ain't as all-pervading as Lagavulin, is a sweet pear-like quality. When young there are notes of the land: heather, moor, sweet seaweed, and a finish that has a distinctive cracked black pepper hit.

Initially salty, then sweet and spicy on the nose, with summer berries, heather honey, and an earthy note, plus subtle peat. Spicy and drying on the slightly waxy palate, with licorice, aniseed, and prominent peat embers. The finish is medium in length, peppery, and relatively tannic.

Ahh....Talisker. That beloved Isle of Skye whisky that tempts so many of us with its heavenly combination of round, textural richness and smoky peat flavors. Now imagine that bright star of a whisky in its incubation period, still forming its integral character, not yet developed or ready to shine in its polished presence. This five year old, unbridled look at Talisker is for true whisky geeks only. Matured in a refill hogshead for only five years, the color is still almost clear and the flavors still maintain much of their new-make youth. The beery and ... Read More »

Tamdhu is this great little distillery that no one seems to have tasted. That's probably because prior to its sale in 2011 to Ian Macleod (proud owners of Glengoyne and the Chieftain's IB), the distillery had been moth-balled and was about set to be demolished. What was once a solid work horse of a whisky, would have been lost to obscurity were it not for the thoughtful people at Ian Macleod. Now we have the wonderful people at Douglas Laing to thank for pulling this exceptional cask from their stocks. Bottled again just under 97 proof, this is about as ... Read More »

There’s no hint of the high strength on the nose, which is all caramel toffee and shortbread, backed with sultana-like sherry cask influence. The palate is the same: nut, dark fruits, and date. Hugely approachable. With water, it’s a matter of…chocolate? Maltesers! All you want in a sherried whisky, and it won’t burn a hole in your wallet either.

Whisky Advocate: "The "Gentle Dram," it says on the bottle’s label, and it certainly is one of the gentler whiskies in Speyside. It’s a fragrant whisky too with a firm malty foundation, fruit gum drops and caramel. Subtle notes of almond and anise helped keep my interest, as did its soft, subtle wood spice finish. Very easy to drink too! (Vol. 13, #3)" Wine Spectator: "A beguiling taste sojourn. Rich wood and leather aromas, with almond notes, turn to sarsaprilla, tropical fruit and anise on the palate.
