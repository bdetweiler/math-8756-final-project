DISTILLERY BOTTLING
A tad less peaty than early bottlings, the classic Ardbeg 17yo is still a great whisky, but is sadly becoming very thin on the ground as demand increases and supply runs low - it's now a good few years since owners Glenmorangie discontinued it. The first bottling of this sparked the revival of Ardbeg's fortunes after the takeover by Glenmorangie. Please note, there is some minor damage to the boxes.

SPECIALITY DRINKS LTD
A sherry-cask-matured dram from the Isle of Arran, aged for 18 years in a puncheon before bottling in August 2015. At 18 years old, it's about as old an Arran as you can get, with them only starting production a year earlier. While it's got the deep colour you'd expect from sherry maturation, on the palate the influence is more restrained, giving richness and complexity while letting the distillery's character shine.

SPEYSIDE SINGLE MALT SCOTCH WHISKY
DISTILLERY BOTTLING
Another fantastic invention from the workbench of Balvenie Malt Master David Stewart – a 17-year-old version of the best selling DoubleWood. Still initially matured in 'whisky oak' casks before being switched to sherry wood to finish, the extra years give it extra depth without being overpowering.

Only a handful of bottlings have ever been released, of which this is perhaps the most interesting. Having bottled what was believed to be the last casks of Ben Wyvis in 1999 under the name 'The Final Resurrection', Whyte & Mackay were somewhat taken aback to discover that one more cask did in fact exist in their warehouses.

Considered by many to be the hidden gem (and bargain) of Diageo's 2013 Special Releases is this 21 year old vintage Cardhu. A distillery that's not that well known on these shores (although is huge in spain), this is a delicate yet complex whisky, with balanced sweet fruit and dark woodiness.

SIGNATORY
When we visit Signatory Vintage's warehouses to choose casks, we always look out for Clynelish. Andrew Symington and his team have a selection of great casks, and some of their Clynelishes are stunning – this is one of them. It has a heavy sherry influence, with dark fruit and spice, but it's not enough to swamp the Clynelish character, with wax and fresh fruit leaping out of the glass after a few minutes. Fruity, spicy and complex – a must-have.

An extraordinary find, this is one of the rarest single malts we've ever come across. Glamis is the single malt from the long-extinct Glenfyne distillery (sometimes also known as Glendarroch), which was situated in Ardrishaig on the edge of Loch Fyne and closed in 1937.

Glen Garioch is a distillery with a comparatively low profile, and quality has varied over its lifetime under a succession of different owners - but real aficionados will tell you that the older expressions are some of the best malts in Scotland. This is a whisky with fruit and floral notes, but also, crucially, some restrained peat.

The first in a new series from Glenfarclas, celebrating the Grant families six generations of ownership. This one has been bottled in honour of John Grant, who purchased the distillery in 1865, and was matured, unusually, in fino sherry casks. It's very different from their other heavily sherried fare, with buckets of toffee, honey and citrus in addition to rich and oaky notes.

Glenfarclas combined ten of their last remaining quarter casks, the youngest of which was 25 years old, to produce this bottling. The whisky has spent all of its life in quarter casks and therefore gives greater wood contact and thus even more complexity and richness than the core 25 year old bottling.

DISTILLERY BOTTLING
An old bottling of Glenfiddich 12 Year Old, consistently amongst the top-selling Scotch whisky brands in the world. We estimate this was bottled in the 1960s, a decade which saw the distillery lead the way, both in becoming the first whisky to be marketed as a single malt and the first Scotch distillery to open a visitor's centre. Please note this bottle has a damaged capsule, as shown in the photograph.

The Signatory warehouses are full of amazing whiskies, but there are a few that we return to when selecting casks to be bottled exclusively for TWE – sherry-matured Glenlivet is one of them. The refill cask adds a rich sherry influence, but still allows the core Glenlivet character to sing, and the whisky is soft and fruity with a backbone of dried fruit and spice. This was awarded 90 points by Serge Valentin on whiskyfun.com.

A frequently-overlooked bottle in Glenlivet's Cellar Collection, perhaps as it remains one of the youngest of the series (even at 20 years old). This is sterling stuff, nonetheless, described by Jim Murray as 'sophistication and attitude rolled into one'. With the finish adding nuance rather than dominating the palate, this is a minor classic of the genre.

DISTILLERY BOTTLING
An old bottling of Glenturret 8 Year Old which, we estimate, dates from the 1980s. A medium-full honeyed malt with attractive youthful brio, the distillery is famous as the home of Famous Grouse - and for Towser, the former distillery cat who caught nearly 30,000 mice.

Extraordinarily rare malt, even by Kinclaith's standards: just 64 (!) bottles were yielded when G&M bottled it in 1996 from what must have been, judging by the colour, an exceptional refill sherry hogshead. Kinclaith was founded in 1957 and closed in 1975. This incredibly scarce Lowlander has never been officially bottled as most of its output went into parent company Schenley International's Long John blend.

SPEYSIDE SINGLE MALT SCOTCH WHISKY
SPECIALITY DRINKS LTD
We're lucky to have reclaimed this excellent Longmorn for The Single Malts of Scotland series - it was originally bottled in 2009 for an overseas market, but was shelved at the last minute. A nutty, appley Longmorn with a generous dollop of clove and cinnamon spices.

A 24-year old-Longmorn, matured in a hogshead and bottled in August 2015 for the Single Malts of Scotland range. Rather than the rich and heavy drams you normally see from the distillery, this shows off the Longmorn's character, showing how much of the richness comes from age and spirit rather than sherry oak.

This Macallan 1946 is rather unusual, in that it was made with peated malt due to the high post-war prices of coal. In our opinion it also happens to be one of the greatest Macallans ever released. The inital release of this was quite large and took a while for the distillery to sell, but it is now recognised as a classic.. Please note the box is cracked in the front right-hand corner, as shown in the photograph.

Something of an oddity, here - this Macallan 1947 was originally bottled for Italy in 1962 as a fifteen year-old, before being repackaged for the Fine and Rare range. This is likely to be more peaty than today's Macallan, as the distillery was forced to use peat in the kilns for a few years during and after WWII because of the scarcity and high price of coal.

SPEYSIDE SINGLE MALT SCOTCH WHISKY
DISTILLERY BOTTLING
A bottling of Miltonduff at 5 years old. We estimate this was bottled in the 1970s for the Italian market, so would have been distilled around the time that the distillery introduced a set of Lomond stills to produce the very rare Mosstowie.

DISTILLERY BOTTLING
A cracking malt from a great, but criminally underexposed distillery, Mortlach has a rich, complex, spicy sherried character and deserves far wider recognition. This looks set to change, with owners Diageo now pushing Mortlach into the spotlight with some new bottlings.

DISTILLERY BOTTLING
A more traditional take on Mortlach than the other releases in the range, focusing on European oak and sherry casks. A vatting of whisky matured in fairly active first-fill sherry casks and refill casks, it gives the big, meaty Mortlach character that fans of the distillery love.

DOUGLAS LAING
A new addition to the bewildering array of Douglas Laing Port Ellens, this one is unusual in that it was finished in a rum cask. A soft, sweet nose leads to a surprisingly spicy palate tempered by exotic fruit sweetness and the typical PE cerealiness (if that's a word).

Water reveals a bitter lemon and other tangy citrus notes. A classic of this 'pure' style.

Amongst the greatest expressions ever bottled by this legendary distillery.

ISLAND SINGLE MALT SCOTCH WHISKY
DISTILLERY BOTTLING
The highlight of 2006's super premium releases from Diageo. This was so popular that we sold through our initial allocation within weeks. This starts off as an elegent dram that builds on the palate to a powerful peaty, smoky, salty, peppery beast, it has complex coastal characters with notes of citrus and the most perfectly balanced finish.
