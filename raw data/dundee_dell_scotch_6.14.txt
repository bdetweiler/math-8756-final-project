Glenallachie-Speyside
Nose: The first impression on the nose is rich and unctuous; scented oil (hair lacquer, Brylcream), sandalwood
and tinned fruit salad. Taste & Finish: The taste is old fashioned, a reminder of how whiskies tasted
long ago: canvas, guy ropes, a distinct whiff of coal smoke; sweet (crystalline coffee sugar) and
slightly mouth drying. A drop of water raises fruity and waxy notes – stewed gooseberries
in suet dumpling, then stewed apples. A smooth texture and a taste reminiscent of old Calvados.
Sweetish to start, with some spice and mouth-drying liquorice; a long finish, and distinct cloves in
the aftertaste. Complex and interesting.

Tamdhu - Speyside
Colour: Amber. Nose: Full, appetizing. Definite sherry character. Body: Light to medium, firm.
Palate: Accent on malty sweetness, but with a nice balance of aromatic, cedary smokiness.
Lots of character, but this becomes evident only after a period of acquaintance. This is a restrained, well-balanced malt.
